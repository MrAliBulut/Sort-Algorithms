## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to rearrange elements of a list or array in a specific order. They play a crucial role in various applications, including data processing, searching, and optimization.

This project aims to provide clear and efficient implementations of popular sorting algorithms, along with explanations of their operation and performance characteristics. By exploring different algorithms and their variations, users can gain insights into algorithmic design and optimization techniques.

## Algorithms Implemented

Here are the sorting algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- *(More algorithms will be added over time)*

Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations of its logic, time complexity analysis, and comparisons with other algorithms.

## Languages

The sorting algorithms are implemented in various programming languages to demonstrate language-specific features and syntax. Currently supported languages include:

- **Java**
- *(More languages will be added in the future)*

## Usage

To use any of the implemented sorting algorithms in Java, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Java` directory.
2. Locate the file corresponding to the sorting algorithm you want to use (e.g., `Selection.java`, `Insertion.java`, `Bubble.java`, `Merge.java`).
3. Open the file and review the comments or documentation within it to understand how to integrate the algorithm into your projects.
4. Instantiate an object of the sorting algorithm class in your Java code.
5. Call the appropriate method (e.g., `minOrder()` for ascending order, `maxOrder()` for descending order) on the object, passing the array you want to sort as an argument.
6. The sorted array will be returned by the method. You can then use it as needed in your application.

## Contributing
